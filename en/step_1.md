## Introduction

In this project, you will create and style a webpage for an anime drawing tutorial. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)**</span> is used to structure a webpage. <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**</span> describes exactly how a webpage should look. Without CSS, a webpage would look really boring.
</p>

You will:
+ Use **HTML** tags to structure a webpage
+ Use **CSS** styles to apply layouts, colour palettes, and fonts to your webpage
+ Add images and text content to your webpage

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**web designer**</span> is someone who plans and designs webpages. There are hundreds of millions of active webpages, so if you use HTML with CSS, it can help your webpage attract people's attention. 
</p>

**Tip:** Drag the scroll bar down to see the full webpage.
