Your starter project contains images to use in this project. To include an image on a webpage, you need to know the filename. First, add an image called `love.png`.

--- task ---

Inside your new section, add an `<img>` tag to display an image. The `src` **attribute** gives the name of the image.

 The `<img>` tag doesn't have an end tag.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Alternative (Alt) text**</span> is a description of an image and is important in accessible web design to describe images to people who are unable to see them. The text does not appear on the webpage but it is read aloud by screen readers.
</p>

--- task ---

Add the `alt` property to provide alternative text for people who cannot view the image. 

You can copy the description of your image and paste it into your code: `The love facial expression.`
