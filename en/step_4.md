## Add more content to your first section

Use tags to add more content to your section

--- task ---

Underneath your `<h2>` heading code, add the paragraph `<p>` tags. 

  --- code ---
  ---
  language: html
  filename: index.html
  line_numbers: true
  line_number_start: 33
  line_highlights: 37
  ---
    <!-- The main content for the webpage goes between the main tags -->
    <main>
      <section>
        <h2>Facial expressions</h2>
        <p></p>
      </section>
        <!-- The first drawing and instructions go here --> 

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Between the `<p>` tags, add in this introductory text:

`Take a look at these facial expressions and try them in your own drawings.`

**Tip:** You can copy the text above and paste it within the `<p>` tags.

Your code should look like this:

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 33
line_highlights: 37
---
    <!-- The main content for the webpage goes between the main tags -->
    <main>
      <section>
        <h2>Facial expressions</h2>
        <p>Take a look at these facial expressions and try them in your own drawings.</p>
      </section>
        <!-- The first drawing and instructions go here --> 

--- /code ---

**Test:** Click the **Run** button. 

The text appears under the subheading and uses the default paragraph styling. 

Well done! Your page now has a header, a subheading, and an introductory paragraph.
