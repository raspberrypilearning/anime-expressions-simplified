## Colours and fonts

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

In this step, you can try out different colour palette and font choices.

Now that you have started to add custom classes to your code, you may have noticed that colour has been added to the page. In CSS, you can use **variables** to create a colour palette for your webpage. 

CSS variables start with two dashes: `--primary`. 

Colours are specified using hexadecimal notation (hex) and begin with '#'. There are lots of websites where you can find hex colours to use.

Go to your `candy.css` file. This file sets the colour variables for the candy colour palette.

In the candy colour palette, the `--primary` variable is set to `#ebeaeb`, a pale grey.

--- code ---
---
language: CSS
filename: candy.css
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 2
line_highlights: 5
---
/* Candy colour palette and fonts */

:root {
  --primary: #ebeaeb;
  --onprimary: #625d61;
  --secondary: #f5bdd5;
  --onsecondary: #1d3d58;
  --tertiary: #b5a9b2;
  --ontertiary: #422215;
  --page: #ffffff;
  --onpage: #000000;
  --detail: #e697b9;
  --detail2: #415a89;

**Tip:** CSS uses different comment markers to HTML. Multiline comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. The browser ignores code that is inside the comment markers. `/* Candy colour palette and fonts */` is an example of a CSS comment.

You can also use variables for fonts. The `--header-font` is set to `3rem 'Fredoka One', cursive;`

`3rem` means that this font should be three times the normal font size. 

`'Fredoka One', cursive` means that the browser should use the 'Fredoka One' font if it can. If this font isn't available, the browser should use the **fallback font**, which is `cursive`.

**Find** the variables that set the fonts for your webpage.

--- code ---
---
language: CSS
filename: candy.css
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 16
line_highlights: 16-19
---

  --body-font: 1rem 'Verdana', sans-serif;
  --header-font: 3rem 'Fredoka One', cursive;
  --title-font: 2rem 'Fredoka One', cursive;
  --quote-font: lighter 1.5rem 'Chewy', cursive;
}

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

The `primary` colours are designed to be used the most in the main content of the page, followed by the `secondary` and then `tertiary` colours. This means that you can easily design new colour palettes and switch between them. 

The starter project also includes a vivid colour palette file called `vivid.css`. 

--- task ---

**Find** the `vivid.css` file. 

Notice that the colour and font variables have the same name, but that the colours and fonts used are different in this colour palette. 

--- code ---
---
language: CSS
filename: vivid.css
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
---

/* Vivid colour palette and fonts */

:root {
  --primary: #68bbe5;
  --onprimary: #000000;
  --secondary: #e2008a;
  --onsecondary: #000000;
  --tertiary: #fdf100;
  --ontertiary: #000000;
  --page: #ffffff;
  --onpage: #000000;
  --detail: #ffa71a;
  --detail2: #41063c;

  --body-font: 1rem Verdana, sans-serif;
  --header-font: lighter 3rem "Bangers", cursive;
  --title-font: lighter 2rem "Bangers", cursive;
  --quote-font: lighter 1.5rem 'Chewy', cursive;
} 

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Go to `index.html` and change the CSS link code to link to the `vivid.css` file: 

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 21
line_highlights: 24
---   
    <!-- Include CSS style file -->

    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <link href="vivid.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

**Test:** Make sure your webpage now uses the brighter colours and different fonts.
